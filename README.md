HablitASE
=========

HablitASE is a secure, in-development staff management panel coded for RevCMS, but is also compatible with other CMS's with some tweaking. We choose RevCMS simply because other management systems, such as UberCMS is just getting too old.

HablitASE will offer hotel owners to easily manage their site and client in the one management panel, providing features such as "External user signon" - which allows staff to log into users' accounts by forcing a SSO ticket. And security features which prevent bruit forcing accounts.

HablitASE has 3 builds, DEVELOPMENT, BETA and RELEASED - development builds should never, for security reasons, be used on a production website. Whereas beta builds can, but may present errors, usually no security holes though. While released builds are approved after beta for production use.

HablitASE build: DEVELOPMENT R100
