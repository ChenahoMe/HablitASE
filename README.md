HablitASE
=========

A secure and reliable staff management panel for RevCMS, coded by Chenaho (.me)

HablitASE is an advanced ASE (housekeeping/staff management panel) allowing site staff to easily manage RevCMS & the in-game client. HablitASE is free-to-use, opensource management panel for all RevCMS based- hotels.

List of features HablitASE plans to integrate:
• Secure logins - to protect staff's accounts
• Dashboard - which sets a welcome message and the functionality of the ASE
• Social management - allows the staff member to edit, create and delete articles & site campaigns
• User management - allows the staff member to edit a user (credits, pixels, rank, email, password)
• Bans management - allows the staff member to create or withdraw a ban against a user
• External signon - allows the staff member to log onto any users client

As the development continues, we may add new features to the list.
